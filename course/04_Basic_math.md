# Chapter 4: Basic math
Of course we can do other things that working with strings, too. Let's do some math.

You can use all normal operators like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. Let's try this:
```typescript
console.log(5 + 7);
console.log(7 / 2);
console.log(28 * 19204);
```

You can also use parentheses to group certain operations, like in normal math.

## Exercise
Create a program which adds, multiplys and substracts the numbers 3, 4 and 17 to get 56 as the result.

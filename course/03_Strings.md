# Chapter 3: Strings
Strings consist of one or multiple letters. They always have to be in quotes, but it doesn't matter if you use double (`"`) or single (`'`) quotes. Example:
```typescript
console.log('This works,');
console.log("and this works, too!");
```
But remember, that your string must begin and end with the same kind of quotes.

## Adding strings together
You can add strings with the plus sign, like so:
```typescript
console.log("First " + "word" + "!");
```

## Exercise
Create a little program, that outputs the text `I really like Typescript`, but don't write everything as one string, instead, add every word together with a plus.

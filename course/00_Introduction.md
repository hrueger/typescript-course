# Chapter 0: Introduction
## What is TypeScript?
According to its [homepage](https://typescriptlang.org), "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript." That means, that every JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript, but TypeScript has much more Features. To get the actual JavaScript code, the TypeScript needs to be compiled. This is done by the `TypeScript compiler` to which we'll get in a minute.

## But wait, what is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language which is used in the world wide web to add user interaction features like info dialogs, prompts and much more. The JavaScript code is run in the Browser's built in `JavaScript engine` or `JavaScript runtime`.

Another popular JavaScript runtime is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This allows us to run JavaScript code outside of the browser which is very handy. We also need it to compile the TypeScript code, because the TypeScript compiler itself is written in TypesScript, which has been compiled to JavaScript.

Install Node.js from their [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you haven't already, also install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor.

Create a new folder for this course. Inside, you will create all the files as the course goes on. Be sure to name your files meaningful, so that you always know, which files belong to which chapter. I recommand a scheme like `00_introduction_01.ts` for the first example in chapter 0 Introduction.

Typescript files always end in `.ts`.
